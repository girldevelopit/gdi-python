# Girl Develop It Python 1 Class, Aug 2022

## Overview
This course is a special series customized for the Deloitte WinC (Women in Computing) group. It's based on the standard GDI Python 1 curriculum, but adjusted for the interests of the group and for alignment with [PCEP exam topics](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep-exam-syllabus), as Deloitte offered participants the option to take the exam at no cost.

This course covers the very basics of the Python programming language, including:
- Data types
- Expressions/operators
- Functions
- Loops
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
