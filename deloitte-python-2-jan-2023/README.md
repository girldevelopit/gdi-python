# Girl Develop It Python 2 Class, Jan/Feb 2023

## Overview
This course is a special series customized for the Deloitte WinC (Women in Computing) group. It's based on the standard GDI Python 2 curriculum, but adjusted for the interests of the group, which included working with APIs and building web apps with frameworks.

This course builds on the basics covered in Python 1 and includes more advanced topics, such as:

- File input/output
- List comprehension
- Error handling
- Argument parsing
- Making HTTP requests/handling responses
- Building web apps with frameworks (Django)

We'll also touch on object-oriented Python and the popular Python web application framework, Django.
